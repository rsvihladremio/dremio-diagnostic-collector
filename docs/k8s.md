# Troubleshooting

## Errors about iostat

There atm is no support for iostat in the dremio docker image, we are working on providing a way for the tooling to install iostat or use an alternative collection method
for the same data in kubernetes, but as of the 3rd of November 2022 we do not yet have a solution. You can safely ignore this error.
